Project Topic : A look at the Big Three : Federer, Nadal, Djokovic
Python notebook using data from ATP Men's Tour 

Reference : DLithe  
Website : www.dlithe.com
Project done under the 
guidance of : DLithe

Done by: Sidharth Kalkura
USN: 4NM17IS101
With the help of the given data set https://www.kaggle.com/jordangoblet/atp-tour-20002016
we will analyse the following players Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and try to visualize the data.
he steps involved in the project are:

1. exploring the dataset also visualizing as well as cleaning the data set .

2. Data preprocessing

3. building machine learning models

4. evaluating the models

5.tuning the parameters for better accuracy

6.upsampling- Upsampling (balanced): decide how many times the sample size of the minority class wants to be used and perform sampling with replacement in the minority class and sampling without replacement in the majority class.

7.final model creation and analysis outcome.

for better accuracy results adaboost classifier is used

AdaBoost is easy to implement. It iteratively corrects the mistakes of the weak classifier and improves accuracy by combining weak learners.



Final result of analysis:
The accuracy obtained is 90 (Random Forest algorithm)
